# spanishTransliterator
Spanish Transliterator for easy typing of special characters.

"Spanish Transliterator.zip" contains executables.
The other two zip files contain source code in Java and JavaFX. 

Sadly I don't really comment my code :(
As a general overview, the code reads key presses, and if they match a preset string, then it simulated backspace (deleting the string) and types in the special character.
Detailed instructions are provided in the "Instructions" file.
