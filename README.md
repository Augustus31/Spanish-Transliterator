# Spanish Transliterator
Spanish Transliterator for easy typing of special characters.

"Spanish Transliterator.zip" and "Spanish Transliterator v2.zip" contain executables.
The other zip files contain source code in Java and JavaFX. 

Version 2 added support for the ü and Ü characters.

Sadly I don't really comment my code :(
As a general overview, the code reads key presses, and if they match a preset string, then it simulates backspace (deleting the string) and types in the special character.
Detailed instructions are provided in the "Instructions" file included in the zip.
